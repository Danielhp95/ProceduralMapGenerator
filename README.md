# ProceduralMapGenerator

Procedural map generator used on my future first Rogue game (Katabasis). So far it is only the bare bones of it. It takes into account 11 possible tiles and creates a map which is coherent (there is a path from beginning to end) and no open roads lead outside the edges of the map. Works for NxN. N being any input. Non-square representations work (even though they need to be rectangular NxM)
